# Shelter

## Project Story & Concept
You have crashed in a vast, frozen forest. Your goal is simple: find the cabin before the cold takes you. "Shelter" is a first-person survival experience where players must navigate a snowy 3D environment, manage their decreasing health/temperature, avoid hidden dangers and locate the warmth of the cabin before time runs out.

## Development Stack
*   **Frontend:** A-Frame (Web-based 3D framework)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express (Web server)
*   **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Install Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2.  **Clone/Download the Project:** Get the project files onto your local machine.
3.  **Navigate to Project Directory:** Open your command line tool (like Terminal or Command Prompt) and go to the directory where your project files are located (the `SHELTER` folder).
4.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the command `npm install`. This installs the required libraries (like Express) listed in the `package.json` file.
5.  **Start the Server:** Run the command `node server.js`.
6.  **Open the Game:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
7. **Alternate way of opening the game** Download live server extension in visual code studio. Locate the html file in vs code and right click on the middle of your screen, then find "Open with Live Server".
